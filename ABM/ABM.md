## A detailed overview of the agent-based model's mechanism
---

The agent-based model is based on [1] where a network-explicit configuration is used.
Instead of make use of mean field theory, the groups as defined in the paper are composed of the selected node and his direct neighbours. In each group, it is possible to know the exact presence of the different agent types (honest,criminals and lone wolves), which facilitates the computation of reward and damage.



In each round of the game, an agent is selected. A round corresponds to an arbitrary unit of time. In contrast to the initial model, if the agent is a law-abiding citizen $h$, a reward for exemplary behaviour is given by increasing his/her fitness by the reward factor $r_h$. When $r_h$ is set to zero, the honest agents merely act as stabilisers in the system. If a criminal $c$ is selected, the agent is referred to as the victimiser of that round and will exert an illicit activity and share an amount $b_c$ of his/her benefits with all his/her direct neighbours who are also part of the organisation, using the following equation:


$$   b_c = \frac{r_c c_c}{n_c}$$

where $r_c$ is the reward factor for a member of a criminal organisation, $c_c$ is the damage factor and $n_c$ is the total number of criminals in the direct neighbourhood. However, the presence of criminal organisations negatively impacts the society by intimidating the population, causing economic damage and harming public security [2,3.4].Consequently, the fitness of the neighbours, such as honest people and lone wolves of the victimiser is affected by a factor $c_c$. In the case of a lone wolf $w$ being chosen as the victimiser, his/her decision on acting and fulfilling his/her ideologies and beliefs is dependent on the presence of MCOs in his/her proximity. Criminal organisations seek to impose social order on a local level, by suppressing non-organisational related crimes or competitive affairs [4,5].
Hence, the acting of a lone wolf is based on the following equation:

$$
acting = \begin{cases}
 true &  \text{if U(0,1)} >= 1 - \delta (1 - p_c)\\
 false & otherwise\\
\end{cases}
$$


where $\delta$ represents the determination of a lone wolf to pursue his/her objective and $p_c$ corresponds to the proportion of MCOs present in the direct neighbourhood.
If $acting$ is true, the lone wolf gathers a benefit defined as:
$$  b_w=r_w c_w $$

In the original paper, the actions of an independent wolf can have a positive impact on criminal organisations. For example, terrorist networks could claim the action and gain in reputation. Such networks would benefit in fitness by sharing a fraction of the reward among the members:

$$ b_c = \frac{\tau r_w c_w}{n_c} $$


where $\tau$ represents the fraction of benefits accruing to the organisation.

After the acting stage, an investigation stage is evoked, during which the three meta-agents apply sanctions to the victimiser. The meta-agents conduct the investigation independent of each-other. The sanctions can only be applied if the investigations were successful. In other words, the penalty can only be applied if the victimiser of that round has been randomly selected. The first meta-agent represents the criminal court of justice, which applies a penalty $\beta_s$ to the victimiser. The second meta-agent corresponds to the social control exerted by civilians which inflicts a social pressure of $\beta_h \times n_h$ on the victimiser. $n_h$ correspond to the number of honest h in the direct neighbourhood of the victimiser. The third meta-agent represents a criminal organisation which conducts only investigations against lone wolves with a penalty $\beta_c \times n_c$ [4,5]. $n_c$ correspond to the number of criminals belonging to an organisation in the direct neighbourhood of the victimiser. If the offender is a member of a criminal organisation and sanctions are imposed, the immediate neighbours belonging to the organisation are also punished with a fraction $\gamma$ of the offender's initial punishment.

In the evolution stage, a randomly selected actor undergoes a change in status based on the following equation:
$$
evolution = \begin{cases}
 S \xleftarrow{R} x & \text{if U(0,1)} <= mutation_{prob}\\
P(k_i\leftarrow k_j) = \frac{1}{e^{-(w_j-w_i)/T}+1}  & otherwise
\end{cases}
$$
where $S$ represents the set of possible statuses (honest, lone wolf, MCO), $S \xleftarrow{R} x$ represents the uniformly random selection of an element $x$ from $S$. $P(k_i\leftarrow k_j)$ corresponds to the probability of the selected actor $i$ to adopt the status of a uniformly random chosen neighbour $j$, where $w$ corresponds to the respective fitness of $i$ and $j$. The equation is based on the Fermi function to simulate the rationally bounded behaviour of actor $i$, where irrational decisions are possible with a certain probability
[6,7]. The probability of this happening is mainly determined by the temperature factor $T$. The evolutionary stage accounts for the social opportunity structure of social ties, where an actor's behaviour is influenced by his/her entourage [8].
Because of the accumulation of benefits and punishments during the simulation, one risks obtaining an important fitness gap between the different nodes, which would keep increasing with the simulation rounds. To mitigate this side effect, an average decay function was introduced to set a limit for the fitness values. The average decay function consists in multiplying the nodes' fitness by $\frac{2}{3}$ to create a rolling average of about 5 rounds. By doing so, this avoids extreme values of the Fermi function, which often leads to numerical overflow. Furthermore, it emphasises averaging the last $n^{th}$ accumulated fitness, which allows for averaging the nodes' behaviours over $n^{th}$ previous rounds.

On the other hand, random mutation is necessary to allow for a random behavioural switch by acting as white noise. Given the case that no criminals are left in the population, the Fermi function cannot rehabilitate any criminals back into society. However, it is presumed that in the long term criminal behaviour will always exist and emerge within a population. Thereby, it is important to have a low frequency of random mutations in the system in order to avoid a convergence to an equal ratio of agent types. In practice, the frequency is set to one over the number of actors or lower to avoid interference with the overall dynamic.

The definition and default values of the parameters are indicated in Table. The table serves merely as a reference point for subsequent analysis in which one or more parameters are subject to changes. The default combinations of parameters have been chosen such that the reward points are the same for MCOs and love wolves, and the penalty systems are equal. Furthermore, the influence of the CO on lone wolves as well as the penalty share between MCOs was set to a relatively low value.

| II.i Theoretical and Empirical Background  | II.i.a Which general concepts, theories or hypotheses are underlying the model’s design at the system level or at the level(s) of the submodel(s) (apart from the decision model)? What is the link to complexity and the purpose of the model? | By running this simulation, a complex interaction between society, law-abiding citizens and criminals are created. The model aims to analyse how the criminal network evolves using different policies (penalties) and interaction factors between criminals and lone wolfs. Thereby, the social opportunity structure underlies the model's design [1,9,10]. As [9,10] pointed out, to simulate the evolution of a Criminal network in the long term, it is necessary to correctly simulate the recruitment phase.                                                   |

In the case of honest civilians, the motivation is to be law-abiding. However, based on the social opportunity structure, actors are influenced by their neighbours to change strategy. The agent can potentially switch states (e.g. from criminal to honest) based on bounded rationality. Bounded rationality is defined by the Fermi function which compares the fitness of one of the neighbours. However, based on his state, the agent has a deterministic action. |

If chosen, criminals do always act if chosen as player of the round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

And if yes, how?                                                                                                                              |                                                                            When agents choose a state, they do so either by using the Fermi function (by comparing fitness with a given neighbour) or by deciding to randomly switch to one of the possible states (honest/lone wolf/criminal) depending on the mutation probability. Thus, if the mutation probability is 1, agents will not choose the Fermi function but will change their behaviour randomly (if they are chosen). Moreover, the Fermi function takes as an argument the temperature which represents the probability of adopting a less profitable strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| III.iii Input Data                         | III.iii.a Does the model use input from external sources such as data files or other models to represent processes that change over time?                                                                                                       | The model is based on the paper from Martinez-Vaquero et al. [1]. The difference is that the ABM has a network-explicit configuration where agents can only interact with their direct neighbours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

In the acting stage, the criminal or lone wolf can exert some damage. In the investigation stage, the victimiser is searched. If the victimiser is found, a penalty is   exerted. Finally, an evolutionary phase is applied. Further details can be found in the section above.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

[1]. To model was parameterised based on arbitrary values. The correctness of the model was ensured by developing an extensive testing frame with the package [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/}) [13]. The correctness of the model was tested using edge cases, where the outcome was known prior.
